          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;">Pit latrines are used daily by the 3.4
            billion people living in rural areas around the world.&nbsp; When
            pits fill, options are limited to pit replication or emptying, which
            are expensive and are rarely performed hygienically in favor of
            cheaper, less effective, and dangerous methods.&nbsp; My research
            describes how human behavior affects fecal sludge management (FSM)
            in rural developing communities.</h4>

              <h4>INTENTIONS WHEN PITS FILL</h4>
              <p>The intentions of rural latrine owners towards fecal sludge
                management of their family's waste are poorly understood and
                critical to sustainable sanitation in developing
                communities.&nbsp; This formative research describes the FSM
                intentions of rural latrine owners in Cambodia.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="services__item icon icon_strategy">
              <h4>EFFECTS OF BEHAVIOR ON FSM</h4>
              <p>While few studies have investigated how human behavior affects
                FSM in rural developing communities, a systematic literature
                review and meta-analysis will be performed to identify what is
                currently known and unknown about how behavior affects FSM.</p>

              <h4>PAST EFFORTS TO CHANGe FSM BEHAVIORS</h4>
              <p>Behavior change techniques have been used to attempt to change
                FSM behaviors in prior studies.&nbsp; A systematic literature
                review and meta-analysis will be performed to identify what
                behavior change techniques have been successful at changing FSM
                behaviors.</p>

              <p>What rural latrine owners decide to do when their latrine pits
                fill is poorly understood but has strong effects on public
                health and the environment.&nbsp; This formative research will
                describe what rural latrine owners in Cambodia do when their
                pits fill (i.e., their FSM behaviors).</p>

              <h4>MOTIVATORS AND BARRIERS TO FSM BEHAVIORS</h4>
              <p>What motivates rural latrine owners to adopt certain FSM
                behaviors is unknown and must be understood to improve FSM in
                rural developing communities.&nbsp; Qualitative methods will be
                used to identify the motivators and barriers to FSM behaviors,
                and quantitative methods will be used to describe variations in
                these behaviors in communities in 10 provinces of Cambodia.</p>

              <h4>BEHAVIOR CHANGE FRAMEWORKS FOR FSM</h4>
              <p>Various behavior change frameworks have been developed for
                different disciplines.&nbsp; Relevant frameworks will be
                evaluated for application to FSM in rural developing
                communities.</p>

              <h4>CHANGING FSM BEHAVIORS</h4>
              <p>Having described FSM intentions and behaviors through
                qualitative and quantitative field studies, and systematic
                literature reviews, an FSM behavior change campaign will be
                performed in rural communities of Cambodia.&nbsp; Effectiveness
                will be measured over short and long terms using follow-up
                qualitative surveying.</p>

                <p class="icon icon_ql">James exceeded expectations on every
                  front when he took over as the Lead Engineer of the EWB-USA
                  San Diego Professional Chapter's India Program.&nbsp; The
                  dedication, intelligence, and organizational skills he's
                  brought to the Program are inspiring, allowing it to double
                  its scope in less than two years.&nbsp; It's rare to find a
                  single individual who is both a top notch engineer and
                  communicator.&nbsp; He can build a local team, help design a
                  complex electro-mechanical system, and coordinate with a large
                  organization, all simultaneously and with equal skill.&nbsp;
                  He travels in environmentally uncomfortable conditions with no
                  complaints and a big smile on his face.&nbsp; James seems
                  custom-made to lead engineering projects in the developing
                  world, and I'm honored simply to have played a small part in
                  helping him find something he's so very excellent at.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p class="icon icon_ql">James was an inspiration to his students
                  in Physics, AP Physics, AP Calculus, Introduction to Coding,
                  and Introduction to Engineering, which he developed.&nbsp; He
                  was professional and reliable in all of his dealings with
                  students, parents and staff.&nbsp; James has a very positive
                  attitude and is very approachable.&nbsp; Its difficult to find
                  an engineer who has such good interpersonal skills.&nbsp;
                  James is a natural teacher and his enthusiasm for his subject
                  really inspires his students.&nbsp; He also coached my
                  6th-grade son's Science Olympiad team for the Bottle Rocket
                  event.&nbsp; They really looked forward to that class with
                  James, and it was great to see James come down to their level.</p>

                  knowledgeable math teachers I have had.&nbsp; Very clear when
                  explaining notes and always willing to help a student with

                <p class="icon icon_ql">I've been working with James on the EWB
                  India Program for the past 3 years. When our power project
                  looked like it couldn't be done in time to meet grant
                  requirements, James worked diligently and led the effort to
                  help us get it done in time, which some team members
                  considered a miracle of sorts.&nbsp; Since taking over the
                  program, he has expanded it's mission into 3 additional
                  projects with enthusiasm and determination.&nbsp; He recently
                  lead the effort to get each fully funded through a large
                  grant.&nbsp; James is very smart, driven and devote to doing
                  some good in the world with a smile on his face.</p>
